            <h1>Computer Graphics</h1>
            <p>
                Computer graphics are graphics created using computers and the representation of image data
                by a computer specifically with help from specialized graphic hardware and software.

                The interaction and understanding of computers and interpretation of data has been made
                easier because of computer graphics. Computer graphic development has had a significant
                impact on many types of media and have revolutionized animation, movies and the video
                game industry.

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe "almost everything on
                computers that is not text or sound".[1] Typically, the term computer graphics refers to
                several different things:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer</li>
                <li>the various technologies used to create and manipulate images</li>
                <li>
                    the sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and
                    manipulating visual content, see study of computer graphics
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Computer graphics is widespread today. Computer imagery is found on television, in newspapers,
                for example in weather reports, or for example in all kinds of medical investigation and surgical
                procedures. A well-constructed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart">graph</a> can present
                complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media "such graphs
                are used to illustrate papers, reports, thesis", and other presentation material.[2]

                Many powerful tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be
                categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated
                graphics. As technology has improved, 3D computer graphics have become more common, but 2D computer
                graphics are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of computer science
                which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past
                decade, other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization, and scientific
                visualization more concerned with "the visualization of three dimensional phenomena (architectural,
                meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes,
                surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component".[3]
